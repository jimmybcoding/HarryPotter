Harry Potter sorting hat quiz app. Project to continue gaining experience with react and hooks like useState and useContext. 
User takes a quiz with each house gaining points saved in state. At the end the winning house's info is rendered.
I have also been learning about responsive design and incorporated that into the CSS.
