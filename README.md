Harry Potter sorting hat quiz app. Project to continue gaining experience with react and hooks like useState and useContext.  

User takes a quiz with each house gaining points saved in state. At the end the winning house's info is rendered.  

I have also been learning about responsive design and incorporated that into the CSS.
